2025-09-07 14:49:59 info: Response: <div><strong>You:</strong> -x</div><div><strong>Bot:</strong> Do you mean the unary negation of x (the negative of x) or subtraction involving x? Here are quick notes in case you’re looking for something specific:

- Meaning: -x is the additive inverse of x. If x > 0, then -x < 0.
- Basic rules:
  - -(a + b) = -a - b
  - -( -x) = x
  - 0 - x = -x
- Examples:
  - -(-3) = 3
  - -(2 + 7) = -9
- Graph: y = -x is a straight line with slope -1 through the origin; reflection of y = x across the y-axis.
- Calculus:
  - d(-x)/dx = -1
  - ∫ -x dx = -x^2/2 + C
- In code: -x typically means negating x (unary minus).

What would you like to do with -x? Provide your context (simplify, plot, differentiate, implement in code, etc.), and I’ll tailor the answer.</div>
